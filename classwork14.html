            <h2>Last dance</h2>
            <h3>Verse:</h3>
            <p>Fatal,this attraction <br>
                Yeah,we might just end up crashin'<br>
                But i'm ready if it happens with you <br>
                Meet me out in Cali <br>
                When I'm far away from family <br>
                And I need someone to hold onto <br>
                You're the only thing I know <br>
                And I don't wanna let this go <br>
                Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home <br>
                Can't wait 'til we're alone <br>
                <br>
                We were built to last <br>
                We were built like that <br>
                Baby, take my hand <br>
                Dive in this romance <br>
                We could burn and crash <br>
                We could take a chance <br>
                Holdin' nothin' back <br>
                Like it's our last dance <br>
                Like it's our last dance <br>
                Like it's our last dance <br>
                <br>
